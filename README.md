# Patterns and Principles

A lightweight, evolving handbook of software-engineering practices, naming conventions, design principles, and small architectural patterns.

The goal is simple: provide short, practical guidance that's easy to reference during code reviews or design discussions.

## What This Repo Contains

- **Smells**: things that might cause trouble. A smell isn't automatically wrong. It's simply a
  signal to pause and consider whether the design or code intent can be expressed more cleanly.

## Philosophy

Good engineering is mostly about:

- clarity of intent
- clear ownership
- well-defined boundaries
- predictable behavior
- and keeping accidental complexity down
